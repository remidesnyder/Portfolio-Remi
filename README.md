# Portfolio

## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ My Portfolio

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

- This is a first project that will allow me to display my projects made by myself, once my skills in react are better, my portfolio will be redone without the help of a Youtube tutorial
## ðŸ›  Skills 
    - HTML, CSS, SASS
    - React
    - Next.js
